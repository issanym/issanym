👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Issa, a 2nd year student passionate about engineering and science.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring the exciting world of programming, software development, computer (systems) engineering, robotics, and open-source projects. I'm eager to learn and grow my skills in C++ and general coding paradigms, and I'm always up for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge.

💻 On GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects(and random stuff) reflecting my journey as I delve into different aspects of programming and development. Whether it's experimenting with coding exercises, working on personal projects, or collaborating with others, I'm committed to sharing my progress and contributing to the community.

🚀 My goal is to leverage GitHub as a platform for learning, collaboration, and showcasing my skills. I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism that can help me improve and become a better developer.

🔍 I'm particularly interested in robotics, computer (systems) enginnering and AI, and I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and potential collaborators who share similar passions and aspirations.

<!---📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn [or other social media platforms]—I'd love to chat, exchange ideas, and explore opportunities together!--->
